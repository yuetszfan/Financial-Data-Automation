# Financial-Data-Automation
This project aims to automate the financial data retrieval and metrics calculation from Taiwan Market Obervation Post System, and then process these metrics with back-end LLM to optimize financial analysis workflow. This is done with Python BeautifulSoup and openAI API.

If you are unfamiliar with Python, you can also use the tool by downloading the excel file first, and then activate macro. You just have to input the search criteria, and then specific financial items will be downloaded and processed automatically.
